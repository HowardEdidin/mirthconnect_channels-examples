# mirthconnect_channels-examples
Examples of mirth connect channels

Introduction 

Here you can find and contribute to content intitiated by Koratech with the intent of making Mirthconnect-based integrations easier.  

Specifications 

This section of the repo contains standard JSON schemas for each HL7 message type, per HL7 version (but will be adding more in the future).  

Message Examples 

Here we provide a couple of examples for each message type, and give you both the HL7 message and the JSON translation.  

Channel Templates 

These exported Mirth channels can be downloaded and imported right into your Mirth instance and get you underway on your integration in minutes. These are fully-functional templates that perform a variety of functions, such as translating an HL7 message to JSON or giving you the framework for building an HTTP Sender. All of the templates are XML files exported from version 3.8.0 of Mirth.   

Code Templates 

This repository is where  some useful code templates that can be downloaded and imported individually separate from the ones that come with the channels themselves. More useful code templates will be added in the future.
